# BMI Calculator GUI

A simple desktop application built with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI), classifies it, and logs your entries.

## Features

- **Validation**: alerts if you enter non-numeric or non-positive values  
- **History**: all past calculations are saved to `bmi_history.csv` and viewable in the app  

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (includes `tkinter`, `csv`, and `os` modules by default)
